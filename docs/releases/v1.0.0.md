## What's New in v1.0.0

### Multi-Agent Swarms

Coordinate multiple specialized AI agents with intelligent routing and parallel execution:

```typescript
import { AgentSwarm } from '@ainative/ai-kit-core'

const swarm = new AgentSwarm({
  supervisor: supervisorAgent,
  specialists: [
    { agent: researchAgent, specialization: 'Web Research', keywords: ['search', 'find'] },
    { agent: analysisAgent, specialization: 'Data Analysis', keywords: ['analyze', 'statistics'] },
    { agent: writerAgent, specialization: 'Content Writing', keywords: ['write', 'create'] }
  ],
  parallelExecution: true,
  maxConcurrent: 2
})

const result = await swarm.execute("Research AI safety and write a report")
```

**Features:**
- Automatic task routing based on keywords and priorities
- Parallel execution for improved performance
- Result synthesis from multiple specialists
- Complete execution traces
- Built-in cost tracking

### Auto-RLHF Instrumentation

Capture every LLM interaction for model improvement without code changes:

```typescript
import { RLHFLogger } from '@ainative/ai-kit-core'

const logger = new RLHFLogger({
  storage: new InMemoryStorage(),
  captureInputs: true,
  captureOutputs: true,
  captureMetadata: true
})

// Automatically logs all interactions
const agent = createAgent({
  rlhfLogger: logger,
  // ... other config
})
```

**Captured Data:**
- User inputs and LLM responses
- Tool calls and results
- Agent steps and decisions
- Token usage and costs
- Latency metrics
- Error events

### Enterprise Safety Guardrails

#### Prompt Injection Detection

Detects 7 attack patterns:
- Direct instruction overrides
- Role switching attempts
- Encoding-based evasion (base64, URL, hex)
- Multi-language obfuscation
- Template injection
- Context manipulation
- System prompt extraction

```typescript
import { PromptInjectionDetector } from '@ainative/ai-kit-safety'

const detector = new PromptInjectionDetector({
  sensitivityLevel: 'HIGH',
  detectEncoding: true,
  detectMultiLanguage: true
})

const result = detector.detect(userInput)
if (result.isInjection) {
  console.log('Attack detected:', result.matches[0].pattern)
  // Take action based on result.recommendation
}
```

#### PII Detection and Redaction

Automatically detect and redact sensitive information:

```typescript
import { PIIDetector } from '@ainative/ai-kit-safety'

const detector = new PIIDetector({ redact: true })
const result = await detector.detectAndRedact(
  "Contact me at john.doe@example.com or call 555-123-4567"
)

console.log(result.redactedText)
// "Contact me at [EMAIL REDACTED] or call [PHONE REDACTED]"
```

**Supported PII Types:**
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Social Security numbers
- IP addresses
- Dates of birth

### Video Processing (NEW)

Screen recording and media device management:

```typescript
import { useScreenRecording, useMediaDevices } from '@ainative/ai-kit'

function RecordingComponent() {
  const { devices } = useMediaDevices({ video: true, audio: true })
  const {
    isRecording,
    startRecording,
    stopRecording,
    recordingBlob
  } = useScreenRecording()

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={startRecording}>Start Recording</button>
      <button onClick={stopRecording}>Stop Recording</button>
      {recordingBlob && <VideoPlayer src={URL.createObjectURL(recordingBlob)} />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Features:**
- Automatic MediaStream cleanup
- Blob URL management with automatic revocation
- Memory leak prevention
- Observability instrumentation

### Transport Layer Improvements

#### SSE (Server-Sent Events) Transport

```typescript
import { SSETransport } from '@ainative/ai-kit-core'

const transport = new SSETransport({
  endpoint: 'https://api.example.com/stream',
  autoReconnect: true,
  maxReconnectAttempts: 5,
  reconnectDelay: 1000
})
```

**Features:**
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- State machine for connection lifecycle
- Error recovery
- Event buffering during reconnection

#### WebSocket Transport

```typescript
import { WebSocketTransport } from '@ainative/ai-kit-core'

const transport = new WebSocketTransport({
  endpoint: 'wss://api.example.com/ws',
  heartbeatInterval: 30000,
  reconnectOnError: true
})
```

**Features:**
- Heartbeat mechanism for connection health
- Automatic reconnection
- State guards to prevent invalid transitions
- Race condition prevention

    setupFiles: ['./vitest.setup.ts']
  }
})
```
